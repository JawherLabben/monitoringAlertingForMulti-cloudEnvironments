# monitoringAlertingForMulti-cloudEnvironments
This project aims to set up a multi-cloud monitoring system using Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana to monitor a Jenkins server. Prometheus is used to collect metrics from the Jenkins server, which are then visualized in Grafana dashboards. Alertmanager is configured to send notifications to Slack when certain alert rules are triggered.
