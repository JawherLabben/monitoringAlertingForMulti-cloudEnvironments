# Monitoring and Alerting For Multi-cloud Environments

To begin with, we will create a dedicated Linux user or system account for Prometheus. This practice provides two significant benefits:
 1- It is a security measure that limits the impact of any security incidents associated with the service.
 2- It simplifies system administration by providing better organization and tracking of resources.
## Features


## Configuration
## Install Prometheus 


First of all, let create a dedicated Linux user or sometimes called a system account for Prometheus. Having individual users for each service serves two main purposes:
It is a security measure to reduce the impact in case of an incident with the service.
It simplifies administration as it becomes easier to track down what resources belong to which service.
To create a system user or system account, run the following command:


## Metrics

### Metric name and help template system


Metric name recommendation: `{name}_{metric}_{aggregation}_{unit}`

Help recommendation: `Azure metrics for {metric} with aggregation {aggregation} as {unit}`

Following templates are available:

| Template        | Description                                                                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{name}`        | Name of template specified by request parameter `name`                                    |

| `{dimension}`   | Dimension value of Azure monitor metric (if dimension is used)                            |
| `{unit}`        | Unit name of Azure monitor metric (eg `count`, `percent`, ...)                            |
| `{aggregation}` | Aggregation of Azure monitor metric (eg `total`, `average`)                               |
| `{interval}`    | Interval of requested Azure monitor metric                                                |
| `{timespan}`    | Timespan of requested Azure monitor metric                                                |
