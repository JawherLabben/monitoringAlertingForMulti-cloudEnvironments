# Monitoring and Alerting For Multi-cloud Environments

### Description

This project aims to implement a multi-cloud monitoring solution for monitoring and managing cloud resources across multiple platforms, such as Azure and AWS. A centralized solution will collect and analyze monitoring data, issue personalized alerts, and display real-time metrics. The goal is to enhance transparency, control, and efficiency in managing cloud resources, while optimizing performance and cost utilization.

The monitoring solution leverages the Prometheus architecture, a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It follows a pull-based model where Prometheus scrapes metrics data from the monitored targets at regular intervals. With the integration of Alertmanager, it provides robust alerting capabilities, including the ability to send alerts to a Slack channel.

In this phase of the project, we will create two virtual machines in the Azure cloud. The first machine will be utilized for monitoring other machines, while the other machine in the Azure and AWS clouds will serve as targets as part of a multi-cloud monitoring setup. The monitoring data collected from these targets will be analyzed and visualized using Grafana, allowing for real-time monitoring and efficient management of cloud resources.

### Features
* Centralized monitoring of cloud resources across multiple platforms
* Real-time metrics and personalized alerts
* Cost optimization for efficient resource utilization
* Support for Azure, AWS, and GCP cloud providers

## Components
The multi-cloud monitoring solution consists of the following key components:

* Monitoring Agent: Collects and sends metrics data from monitored cloud resources to the centralized monitoring system.

* Centralized Monitoring System: Stores and analyzes metrics data, providing real-time visualization and customizable dashboards.

* Alert and Notification System: Issues custom alerts based on predefined thresholds or abnormal conditions, supporting various notification channels. In this project, the notification channel used is Slack, providing real-time alert notifications to the designated Slack channel.
* Visualization and Reporting: Leverages Grafana for data visualization, enabling stakeholders to monitor resource utilization and track performance trends.

* Configuration Management: Centralized interface for managing monitoring agent configurations, alert rules, and visualization settings.
## Overview
### Prometheus Architecture

The monitoring component of this solution is based on the Prometheus architecture, a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. Prometheus follows a pull-based model, where it scrapes metrics data from the monitored targets at regular intervals. The key components of the Prometheus architecture are:

* Prometheus Server: Responsible for collecting and storing metrics data from the monitored targets.
* Metrics Exporters: Agents or plugins that expose metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape.
* Targets: The machines or services that are monitored and provide metrics to Prometheus.
* Alertmanager: Handles alert notifications based on predefined alerting rules.
* Grafana: A popular data visualization tool used to create dashboards and visualize metrics collected by Prometheus.

This diagram shows the architecture of Prometheus and some of its ecosystem components.

Prometheus extracts metrics directly from instrumented jobs, or through intermediate push gateways for short-lived jobs. Store all collected samples locally and run rules on that data to aggregate and record new time series from existing data or generate alerts. You can visualize the collected data using Grafana or any other API consumer.

### What are metrics
 
In layperson terms, metrics are numeric measurements. Time series means that changes are recorded over time. What users want to measure differs from application to application. For a web server it might be request times, for a database it might be number of active connections or number of active queries etc.

Metrics play an important role in understanding why your application is working in a certain way. Let's assume you are running a web application and find that the application is slow. You will need some information to find out what is happening with your application. For example the application can become slow when the number of requests are high. If you have the request count metric you can spot the reason and increase the number of servers to handle the load.
